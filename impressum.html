<p>This is the Data Privacy Statement of Artur Kos, Blackbird Collective  (hereinafter: “Blackbird Collective”). This Privacy Statement governs the use of the services offered at www.theblackbird.de as well as all other Blackbird Collective’s services. This Privacy Statement applies to all users of the website www.theblackbird.de and users of Blackbird Collective’ services (“Users”). This Privacy Statement shall be valid for all visitors of the website, registered candidates, customers, persons who have contacted Blackbird Collective and are interested in working with Blackbird Collective as well as all cooperation partners of Blackbird Collective.</p>
<p>Blackbird Collective is committed to protecting the data of its Users and will process all data voluntarily submitted by Users to Blackbird Collective during the usage or collected by Blackbird Collective during the usage in compliance with valid and applicable data protection provisions, in particular those of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG) and the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz – TMG). Detailed information can be retrieved from this Data Privacy Statement.</p>
<h3>1. SCOPE</h3>
<p>This Privacy Statement governs the services offered by Blackbird Collective at the domain www.theblackbird.de and all other services. Insofar as other websites of Blackbird Collective provide other privacy statements, these shall be applicable. This Privacy Statement does not apply to third websites which are made available through links on the Blackbird Collective website. Blackbird Collective shall not be responsible for the compliance of third parties with data protection regulations. For this reason, Users should thoroughly read the privacy statements of such linked websites.</p>
<h3>2. DATA CATEGORIES AND COLLECTION OF DATA</h3>
<p>In order to optimize its services, Blackbird Collective collects personal data of the Users when they visit the website www.theblackbird.de. In addition, Blackbird Collective collects personal data, which Users submit voluntarily in electronic or other form to Blackbird Collective, e.g. customers or cooperation partners enquiring about a potential collaboration with Blackbird Collective, candidates applying for a job that was posted on the job board or submitting a spontaneous application or in relation with other services offered by Blackbird Collective.</p>
<p>2.1 Personal data: Personal data comprise all information about personal and factual circumstances of a definite or definable natural person. This includes information like name, e-mail address, postal address.</p>
<p>2.2 Specific personal data: Blackbird Collective does not collect information about ethnic or racial origin, political, religious or philosophical believes, trade union membership, health or sexual orientation unless the User himself discloses such information at his own will during the communication with Blackbird Collective.</p>
<p>2.3 Inventory data: Blackbird Collective collects personal data that are required for the creation, the content or changes of the contract between the corresponding User and Blackbird Collective (so called inventory data).</p>
<p>2.4 Usage data: Insofar as required by Blackbird Collective, Blackbird Collective will collect and use the data of a User in order to enable the proper and contractual usage of the services offered at www.theblackbird.de as well as for billing purposes (so called usage data). Usage data contain specific features for identifying the User and information about the start and the end of the usage as well as of the extent of the usage.</p>
<h3>3. USAGE OF DATA</h3>
<p>Blackbird Collective only collects and processes personal data of Users if they are reasonably required to serve the legal business purpose and if the User has submitted his personal data on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>3.1. Statistical data logging: In addition to the information provided by Users, the system of Blackbird Collective automatically collects information during the visit of the website (usage data). These include data about e.g. the type and version of the browser, the operating system, the date, time and duration of the visit, or the address of the visited sites, name and volume of accessed files, the IP address of the User and the domains from which the User accesses the services of Blackbird Collective. These data are used for statistics in order to optimise the content and technical quality of the services available at the domain www.theblackbird.de.</p>
<p>The IP address is used to identify the computer that is connected to the Internet. This can also be used to localize the computer. The IP address is transferred with each server inquiry, so that the server knows where to send the reply to. Each User receives the IP address from his internet service provider (ISP) as soon as he connects to the Internet; the ISP can track which IP address was assigned to which User at which time. As long as the IP address is stored, it might theoretically be possible to identify the subscriber to the telecommunication services via the ISP. Blackbird Collective stores the IP address of the User, inter alia, when he enters the IP address during the registration and login process.</p>
<p>3.2 Cookies: Blackbird Collective may use cookies. Cookies contain information that is sent by the Blackbird Collective website to the browser or a browser plug-in of the User; subsequently, this information will be stored as a text file on the system of the User. If cookies are used, the Blackbird Collective website can memorize information about the User and his settings, either until the User closes the current browser window (“session cookies”) or until the User deactivates or deletes the cookie.</p>
<p>3.3 Google Analytics: The website services of Blackbird Collective use Google Analytics provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, small text files that are stored on your computer and which enable Google Analytics to analyse the User’s usage of the website. The information about the usage of the Blackbird Collective website as generated by the cookie (including the User’s IP address) will be transferred and stored on a Google server in the USA. Google will use this information to analyse the usage of the Blackbird Collective website, to generate reports about activities on the site for Blackbird Collective as the operator and to provide other services in relation with the usage and internet usage. In addition, Google might forward this information to third parties if required by legal provisions or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google. According to its own specifications, Google will not associate the IP address of a User with other data of Google. Users can avoid cookies by changing the settings of their browser; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use the full functionality of the website services offered by Blackbird Collective. By using the website services of Blackbird Collective, the User declares to agree to Google’s processing of his personal data in the way and for the purposes described before.</p>

<p>b) Usage of personal data for agency services: The User gives his approval that Blackbird Collective can use the provided personal data in order to fulfil its services as a staffing agency, to enable the placement of candidates and to carry out consultancy services for customers.
